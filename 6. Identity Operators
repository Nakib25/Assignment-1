# Identity Operators

# Create two variables with the same value
x = [11,22,33]
y = [11,22,33]

# Create another variable 
z = x

# 'is' checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory
print("x is z:", x is z)

# 'is' checks if two variables memory location is not same but objects are same
print("x is y:", x is y)

# 'is not' checks if two variables do NOT refer to the same memory location
print("x is not y:", x is not y)
